\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a study of developing a hybrid configuration (SSD and HDD) for storage needs of HPC environments. Specifically, we proposed an integrated object placement framework with adaptive learning algorithms. The method placed data objects with considering both the popularity of the data and the capability of different storage devices, so that the data access performance can be optimized. The method also integrated a Markov chain algorithm where real-time classification is employed to predict the popularity of data object accesses, so that they can be placed on, or migrate between SSD or HDD drives in the most efficient manner. Our preliminary results based on realistic data traces demonstrate that this approach is highly promising, and achieves better performance than benchmark methods such as pure random selections.
